# CardMarket Best Offers Finder

## Overview

This is a side project made only to improve my experience using the CardMarket website as a customer (spoiler: it is bad)
It's a Kotlin application designed to help card collectors find the best offers on CardMarket.com by their specified preferred sellers.
This application scraps their website (sadly they didn't give me an API key :c) to retrieve card listings and prices from sellers and identifies the best offer combination.

## Run
The application will run a REST API which you can call. Check the `/docs` OpenAPI.

## Testing
All tests are e2e built with cucumber
